ABSTRACT
Room acoustic models are used in immersive applications to create
convincing virtual environments.   The computational cost of full-
scale physical models remains prohibitive for most real-time aural-
isation systems. Scattering delay network (SDN) is a perceptually-
motivated and computationally efficient modelling concept that ren-
ders the line of sight and first-order reflections accurately,  whilst
approximating higher order reflections with progressively coarser
spatio-temporal resolution. This paper develops a generalised SDN
framework capable of rendering reflections up to a selected order
accurately. The generalisation requires two issues to be considered:
i) spherical spreading attenuation,  and ii) placement of scattering
nodes, both of which are addressed here.  Simulations demonstrate
that the proposed model has a similar energy behaviour to that of
the image source method (ISM) and improves over standard SDN in
terms of normalised echo density and in terms of accuracy of delay,
attenuation and direction of early reflections, whilst maintaining the
same complexity as standard SDN.

1. INTRODUCTION
Room acoustic models are used to provide users with more convinc-
ing  virtual  environments  in  an  increasing  number  of  applications
[1].  These applications include cinema, video games, object-based
audio (OBA) applications, as well as extended reality (XR), where
artificial reverberation is matched to a virtual room setup to enhance
the realism and the sense of immersion in the reproduced scenes.
Room acoustic models can be categorized into three main groups:
delay networks, physical room models, and convolution-based al-
gorithms [2].
Physical models have the ability to render desired sound fields
accurately,  however  their  high  computational  cost  makes  them
largely  impractical  for  real-time  applications.   Convolution-based
algorithms  require  the  measurement  or  simulation  of  numerous
room impulse responses (RIRs) covering the entire scene.   Addi-
tionally,  the measured RIRs must be interpolated to enable inter-
activity.   Delay  network-based  models  provide  a  computationally
efficient solution, but their control parameters do not correspond to
physical or geometrical features of enclosures, necessitating ad hoc
tuning of the acoustic (instead of geometric) parameters.
Scattering delay networks (SDNs)   [3, 4, 5, 6] are models in-
spired  by  the  concept  of  digital  waveguide  meshes  (DWM)  [7]

that  aim  to  reduce  the  number  of  nodes  in  the  mesh  to  the  min-
imum needed to reproduce first-order reflections accurately.  This
results in a network of scattering nodes,  each approximating one
wall.  Normalised echo build up density profiles and reverberation
times  of  SDN  room  simulators  approximate  closely  those  of  the
image source method (ISM) [8, 9] whilst achieving orders of mag-
nitude reduction in computational complexity [4]. In listening tests,
SDN-generated reverberation achieved a higher perceived natural-
ness than feedback delay networks (FDNs) [10, 11, 12], convolution
methods and ray-tracing [13] and a greater sense of externalisation
than higher-order ambisonics measurements [14].
SDNs were successfully incorporated in various applications,
including real-time binaural rendering [14, 15] and AR audio ap-
plications [16].  However, the existing SDN approach cannot accu-
rately model higher-order reflections, while there is an increasing
demand for more accurate and flexible artificial reverberators. A re-
cent perceptual study comparing a standard SDN model to modified
higher-order SDNs suggested that increasing the number of accu-
rately modelled reflections can improve the perceived naturalness of
the generated reverberation [17], but since it was done by increasing
the number of nodes, this resulted in a significant additional com-
putational  cost.   Another  perceptual  study  showed  that  rendering
changes in source directivity satisfactorily requires accurate mod-
elling of early reflections up to at least the second order [18].
In this paper we extend the SDN concept to enable a flexible se-
lection of the desired highest-order reflection to be reproduced ex-
actly while keeping the low computational complexity of the stan-
dard SDN. The method is based on an alternative formulation for
calculating  the  attenuation  in  the  model’s  delay  lines.   Addition-
ally, we explore different approaches for setting the positions of the
scattering nodes. These different variations of the proposed higher-
order SDN method are then evaluated in comparison with the stan-
dard SDN method and ISM in cuboid room scenarios.
2. BACKGROUND
An SDN consists of a network of bidirectional delay lines connect-
ing scattering nodes, one for each wall of the modelled room.  The
network  further  includes  source  and  receiver  nodes  that  are  con-
nected to the scattering nodes via unidirectional dissipative delay
lines.  The direct path is modelled by an absorptive delay line that
connects the sound source node directly to the receiver node.  The
room geometry and the source and listener positions can be updated
in real-time to simulate dynamic scenes [4].   Figure 1a depicts a
standard SDN configuration.
In SDNs, the source node acts as the excitation point that in-
jects the input signal into the scattering network.  Scattering nodes
recursively reflect incoming signals to other scattering nodes and to

the receiver.  This is achieved by multiplying the vector of signals
incoming from other nodes by a scattering matrix, to obtain a vec-
tor of outgoing, reflected signals. The scattering matrix is designed
to be unitary [19], to ensure that the scattering operation preserves
energy [12] and that the system is stable when coupled with dissi-
pative delay lines and wall absorption.  The scattering operation is
similar to the one implemented in digital waveguide meshes [7] and
is isotropic,i.e.it does not depend on the incidence or reflection di-
rections.  In addition to the scattering operation, filtering is applied
to outgoing signals before they are passed to the delay lines in order
to model the wall absorption.
A fundamental strength of the SDN model is that its parameters
are derived directly from the enclosure it simulates and, therefore,
have explicit physical interpretations. For instance, the nodes of the
model correspond to locations in space,  while the delay between
the nodes is given by the propagation time between their physical
locations. As early reflections strongly contribute to the perception
of the spaciousness of a room [20], another important characteristic
of SDNs is its ability to exactly model the first-order reflections.
This is achieved by placing scattering nodes at points where first-
order reflections bounce off the walls of the modelled enclosure (see
Figure  1a),  matching  the  delay-line  lengths  to  the  exact  physical
length of the propagation path of these reflections.
The gains of the delay lines are chosen so as to model the atten-
uation associated to spherical energy spreading.  More specifically,
the gains of the source-node delay lines and the node-receiver delay
lines are set as:

respectively, whereα
k
is the distance between the source and the
nodek, andβ
k
is the distance between the nodekand the receiver.
This choice ensures that the total attenuation, given by the product
of the two gains,  is the exact attenuation of the first-order reflec-
tions:g

The accuracy of the second-order reflections varies depending
on the specific reflection but the delays of the approximated paths
remain similar to the actual physical paths [3]. The approximations
become coarser as the reflection order increases.   Thus,  SDN be-
haves equivalently to geometric-acoustic methods such as ISM up
to the first-order reflections, while providing a degrading approxi-
mation for higher-order ones.  This design is motivated by the di-
minishing perceptual importance of reflection accuracy as their or-
der increases, and results in a complexity that is one to two orders
of magnitude lower than (fft-based) convolution alone [4].
Several studies have extended SDN capabilities,e.g.to handle
coupled enclosures [5], to include additional nodes to improve its
physical accuracy [17] and to model outdoor scenes [21]. This work
introduces an extension to accurately render early reflections up to
a given order,  whilst maintaining its complexity to the minimum
of one scattering node per wall.   The proposed extension will be
referred to as the higher-order SDN (HO-SDN), whilst the original
concept will be referred to as the standard SDN.
3. PROPOSED APPROACH
The  objective  of  the  proposed  HO-SDNs  is  to  accurately  model
higher-order reflections up to a desired order, while approximating
the late reverberation to maintain low computational cost of render-
ing of the room acoustic component that does not require the same
level of accuracy to maintain perceived reverberation quality.
Assume that one wishes to render exact early reflections up to
orderN.  The proposed method involves treating the reflections up
to  and  including  orderN−1differently  from  the  reflections  of
higher orders.  The former are treated as separate delay lines with
the correct delay and attenuation connected directly to the receiver
(see the red dotted arrow in Figure 1b), with no interaction with the
recursive part of the network.  The reflections of orderN, on the
other hand, feed the recursive network. More specifically, eachNth
order  reflection  is  modelled  by  connecting  the  source  directly  to
the scattering node on the wall of the last “bounce” of the reflection
(see the dash-dotted line in Figure 1b), and from the node it is partly
sent to the receiver.  As there are6×5
N−1
Nth order reflections
(assuming a cuboid room [22]), each scattering node is fed by5
N−1
such reflections.  The length of the node-receiver delay line is set
according to the length of the node-receiver pathβ
k
, while that of
the source-node delay line,α
k
, is set such that the total pathα
k
+β
k
matches  the  correct  physical  path  (denoted  asδ
true
in  Figure  1b)
in length.   This design makes the HO-SDN structure converge to
the standard SDN model whenN= 1.  The block diagram of the
proposed HO-SDN is shown in Figure 2.
The  main  difference  between  [17]  and  the  low-complexity
SDNs proposed in this paper is that in [17] the number of scatter-
ing nodes increases with the order, while in this paper the number
of nodes remains one per wall (i.e.  6 in a cuboid room) regardless
of the desired order.  Considering that the complexity of SDN in-
creases asO

methods proposed in this paper have a dramatically lower complex-
ity than [17], and comparable to that of standard SDNs.

the same attenuation strategy of equation (1). More specifically, it is
not possible to calculate the node-receiver attenuation,g

there are multipleα

address this issue, we propose to invert the distribution of the simple

Here, the corrective term is applied to the source-node path (instead
of node-receiver), while the attenuation of the node-receiver delay
line is common to allNth-order reflections and is set according to
the node-receiver distance, making the calculation possible.
3.2. Node position strategies
In standard SDN models, scattering nodes are placed at positions
where the first-order reflections impinge on the walls. This method
allows to maintain correct delays and angles of incidence of the first
order reflections.  However, for an HO-SDN model withN >1,
multiple reflections of the same order bounce off each wall.  Thus,
the standard SDN method to define node locations cannot be ap-
plied in the higher-order case.   Several placement strategies were
examined, as illustrated in Figure 3:
i) The nodes can be placed at the location where the first reflec-
tion of theNth order bounces off the wall. In this scenario, the node
position is set by the earliest reflection with the strongest amplitude,
while otherNth order reflections do not influence the node position.
This strategy prioritises the accurate reproduction of the direction of
arrival of the perceptually most important reflection from each wall
and will be referred to as thefirst-reflectionstrategy.
ii) An alternative strategy is to position the scattering nodes at
the centroid of allNth order reflection points.  In this strategy, no
specific reflection is prioritised and the resulting angle of incidence
is an average of all the reflections from a wall. This strategy will be
referred to as theintersection-centroidstrategy.
iii) Studies have shown that incorporating delay lines parallel
with the enclosure axes can improve the accuracy of axial frequency
modes in acoustic models [22, 23].  Considering a rectangular ge-
ometry, positioning the scattering nodes at wall centres aligns the
delay lines connecting opposite pairs of walls to said axes. Towards
enhancing the accuracy of modelled room modes, we consider plac-
ing the nodes at the centre of the walls, which will be referred to as
thecentre-wallstrategy.
The advantage of the first reflection and intersection-centroid
strategies is that they converge towards the standard SDN solution
whenN= 1, providing accurate first-order reflections.
4. EVALUATION
The proposed structures are compared to the image source method
(ISM) and the standard SDN. All SDN and HO-SDN RIRs were
produced using a Python implementation. The ISM RIRs were gen-
erated using a Python implementation of [24]. The RIRs were gen-
erated without the use of fractional delay or air absorption. To mit-
igate the sweeping echoes in the ISM RIRs, a randomisation tech-
nique  for  the  image  source  positions  with  a  range  of  10  cm  was
employed [24]. The simulated room dimensions were6×4×7m,
with the source positioned at[3.6,1.3,5.3]m and the receiver at
[1.2,2.4,1.8]m. Wall absorption was set at0.1for all walls.
Results not included here show that, as expected, the RIRs pro-
duced by HO-SDN have an increasingly good match with the one
produced by ISM with increasing orderN.  The considered mod-
els were assessed in terms of objective metrics provided by energy
decay  curves  (EDC)  and  reverberation  time  (T60)  [22],  and  nor-
malised echo density (NED) [25].
4.1. Energy decay curve and reverberation time
The EDC provides a measure of the energy decay rate of a RIR. Fig-
ure 4 compares the EDCs of the reference methods to the proposed
HO-SDN with the three node positioning strategies forN= 1,2,3.
While  all  SDN-based  methods  suffer  from  an  initial  drop  in  the
early EDC, their decay quickly becomes exponential (correspond-
ing to linear EDC in dB), in line with the expected energy behaviour
of rooms with frequency-independent uniform absorption  [22, 26].
Thecentroidstrategy provides the closest EDCs to the ISM, while
thecentre-walland thefirst-reflectionstrategies appear to have re-
spectively slightly shorter and longer T60s.   Table 1 presents the
T60s  of  each  model  and  strategy  with  the  Sabine  value  as  refer-

4.2. Normalised echo density
The NED provides a measure of the deviation of a windowed part
of an RIR from Gaussian noise.  It was found to be strongly cor-
related to the perceived reverberation texture [25].  Figure 5 shows
the  time  evolution  of  the  NED  for  the  proposed  HO-SDN  struc-
tures with intersection-centroid strategy forN= 1,2,3, along with
ISM and standard SDN. It can be observed that asNincreases, the
HO-SDNs tend to converge towards the ISM’s NED. This is in part
expected, since the RIR of HO-SDNs match the ISM’s RIR for a
longer time period. However, it should be noted how the echo den-
sity of the third-order HO-SDN continues to match the echo den-
sity of the ISM even beyond the time where the reflections are no
longer rendered exactly (25 ms), indicating that the strategy adopted
to feed the recursive network is effective in approximating the de-
lay of reflections beyondN.  Results not shown here indicate that
HO-SDN does not appear sensitive to the particular node placement
strategy in terms of time evolution of the NED.
4.3. Computational complexity
The  only  additional  cost  of  the  HO-SDNs  proposed  here  comes
from the computation of the delay and attenuation of early reflec-
tions up to orderN−1and the associated convolution with the in-
put signal.  This results in only negligible additional computational
cost beyond that of the standard SDN. The delay and attenuation of
the early reflections are computed using the ISM [27]. Considering
that ISM requires 25 operations per image source [4], and that in a
cuboid room there are6 + (N−1)(12 + 4(N−2))unique image
sources up to orderN, the number of operations forN= 3is 950.
In a dynamic simulation where this is recomputed, say, 50 times per
second,  this would amount to just 50 kFLOPs (0.3% of the SDN
complexity, assuming sampling frequency of44.1KHz [4]).  Ad-
ditionally, to model exact reflections up to orderN, a tapped delay
line can be deployed, requiring 1.7 MFLOPs (11% extra compared
to SDN). For context, overlap-add convolution with a full impulse
response has a cost of 200 MFLOPs (assuming a T60 of 0.5 s, and
an update rate of 50 Hz [4]), and this does not even take into account
the computation of the RIR itself.
5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented a low-complexity approach for room acous-
tics simulation based on scattering delay networks capable of mod-
elling precisely higher-order reflections up to a selected order. The
introduced HO-SDN model employs a modified attenuation distri-
bution compared to the standard SDN. Moreover, three strategies to
determine the position of the scattering nodes were explored.  Ob-
jective measures showed that the proposed model performs on a par
to the image source method (ISM) in terms of energy behaviour and
improves over standard SDN in terms of normalised echo density,
correctness of delay, attenuation and direction of early reflections,
all while maintaining the low complexity of the standard SDNs.
Future work will investigate the energy drop in the early sec-
tions of energy decay curves and propose solutions. In addition, we
are planning to evaluate the proposed methodology perceptually.
